# CoinToss
- R programming coupled with statistics. A simple and neat program to find permutations of coin tosses.
- While reading a stats book for dummies I came across this tedious thing were you had to learn about coin toss outcomes.
- After re-living my high school days doing this by hand, i seriously got tired and I was like F*** it if this is something that must be done by hand in an interview because, at the time, I was still seriously sold on getting a job. I still want work, but not that desperate anymore.
- I whipped up this little gem with syntax reference from higher tenured pros in the R game and really at the time I was not sure if it made sense. This turned out great and I was glad I did not have to do this BS by hand anymore.
- Fast forward to today and this gem here led me to develop normfluodbf and if the numbers are anything to hang my hat on, this gem started a fire that if I guard with my life could lead to better things.
- This was my seed and thank goodness it is playing out Ok so far. A lot to learn but I am just warming up.
